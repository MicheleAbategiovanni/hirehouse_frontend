# üè† <strong>HireHouse - Front-End Project</strong> 

<strong>Hirehouse</strong> is a project based on the famous <strong>AirBnb Web App</strong>. <br>
This project was <strong>made in team</strong>, where you will find the thanks at the bottom, in three weeks of development. <br>
It was created through an initial analysis of the layout we wanted to create with the help of <strong>Figma</strong>, and then proceeded to write the code. <br>
The technologies used were: <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>SASS</strong>, <strong>BootStrap</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong> and <strong>Axios</strong> <br>


## <strong>About Project</strong>

This project shows the front-end part of our application, which communicates through <strong>APIs</strong>, to the back-end part.
Within the project, we will find three main pages, created with the help of Vue-Router, which are:
- <strong>HomePage</strong> 
- <strong>Index / Research advanced</strong> 
- <strong>Show apartments</strong> 

<br>

### <strong>HomePage</strong> 

In the Homepage section, we will find the entire initial phase of the web app, i.e. a slider that takes us to the Index page where we can view all the apartments or do some research.
A slider containing all the apartments sponsored by their respective owners.
Links to access the back-end side of the application and finally a section dedicated to the main Italian tourist cities, which will redirect to the Index page with search filters for that selected location.

<br>


### <strong>Index / Research Advanced</strong> 

In the Index page, we have three methods to enter it:
- Through the <strong> main search navbar </strong>, which redirects us to the Index applying the search filter for that city
- Through a <strong>'Scoprilo Ora'</strong> button located in the main <strong>jumbotron</strong>, which allows us to view all the available apartments
- Through the <strong>footer section</strong> which redirects us to the Index by applying the search filter for the selected city

Inside the page, we have the visualization through the <strong>Cards</strong> to visualize the respective information of the apartment with its relative image.
We also have the possibility through the <strong>sidebar</strong> located at the top of the page, to carry out searches, <strong>to set filters</strong> also on the apartments we want to view.
Everything will be managed through an <strong>API</strong> call, which is generated towards our back-end which will return the desired results through paginations.

<br>

### <strong>Show</strong>

On the Show page, we will see all the information relating to the selected apartment on the screen, for example: Title, address, image, location of the apartment, etc. <br>
As far as the <strong>position</strong>  is concerned, the <strong>TomTom map</strong> was used which, through the coordinates stored in our <strong>DB</strong> and received via an <strong>API</strong> call, returns the exact position of the apartment with its relative pop-up marker. <br>
In addition to these general data, we have the possibility through a form to forward a message to the owner of that apartment by entering the correct data, it will be forwarded and for a few seconds we will see the result of a message sent correctly and then disappear after a set period of time , to allow you to send another message.
